# Module 4

Author: Sean Jones

## Module Description

In order to get the module working properly, one client has to be opened and then the port in the aftr.conf file needs to be changed.
Then the second client may be opened. 'X' can be used to spawn a new cube with an offset in both clients and WASD controls can move the original
object in both clients. QE controls will also rotate the original object. Camera controls have been moved to numpad 1,2,3,5.
Pressing 1 not on the numpad will prompt that client's console for a string. Upon entering a string the players label will be updated on both clients.
